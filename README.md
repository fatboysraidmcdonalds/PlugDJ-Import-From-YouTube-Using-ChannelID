# PlugDJ-Import-From-YouTube-Using-ChannelID
Allows you to import playlists to PlugDJ using ChannelID instead of Username <br />
<b>NOTE:</b> This uses the method shown in https://www.reddit.com/r/plugdj/comments/3ixh34/yet_another_youtube_import_hack_for_those_with/
I did NOT come up with this <br />
(However, I did make the bookmarklet and added the feature of changing the textbox "YouTube Username" to "YouTube ChannelID" <b>:]</b>)

# Instructions
1) Open plug.dj <br />
2) Open the playlist UI <br />
3) On the bottom left, click "Import" <br />
4) Run the script (open this <a href="https://rawgit.com/fatboysraidmcdonalds/PlugDJ-Import-From-YouTube-Using-ChannelID/master/Bookmark.js" target="_blank">Bookmark</a> link, copy the text on that page, create a bookmark, paste the text into the URL parameter of the bookmark, then save, open the plug.dj tab, and click the bookmark) <br /> The textbox that says "YouTube Username" should change to "YouTube ChannelID" <br />
5) Open youtube (in another tab or browser <b>:]</b>) <br />
6) Open the profile of the channel of the playlist you want to import <br />
7) The URL will read https://www.youtube.com/channel/<b>ASDASDASDASDASD</b> the <b>ASDASDASDASDASD</b> part is what you'll want to copy to your clipboard <br />
8) Go back to plug and paste the <b>ASDASDASDASDASD</b> into the "YouTube ChannelID" <br />
9) Press "import" <br />
10) ??? <br />
11) Profit <br />
12) I've used this same (outdated) meme in two other gits. I need a new meme.
